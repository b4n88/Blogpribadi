Hi, my name is Albani, I am a permanent employee at Indomaret and I have been officially Indomaret since the end of 2018. During my time at Indomaret I have moved divisions twice even though I was still in the same department. Currently, I am a Clerk in Indomaret's Virtual Business division, in the Financial Accounting Department (FAD). While working, I am also pursuing a distance learning degree in Statistics at the Open University. In this blog writing project, I am in my final semester.

And I am a Statistician, Data Analyst and Market Research enthusiast. Throughout my studies, I have honed my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, interpretation and market research results to provide valuable insights in a variety of areas. I would like to apply my knowledge and skills to challenging statistical projects and am also open to opportunities in other fields that require in-depth data analysis. With a strong educational background and passion for learning, I am confident I can make a significant contribution to your team.
